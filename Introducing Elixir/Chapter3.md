CHAPTER 3 Atoms, Tuples, and Pattern Matching

Atoms
  - Atoms have a value—it’s the same as their text
  - What makes atoms exciting is the way that they can combine with other types and Elixir’s pattern-matching techniques to build simple but powerful logical structures.

Pattern Matching with Atoms
  - Atoms play a key role in pattern matching.

Atomic Booleans
  - Elixir uses the values true and false or :true and :false.

Guards
  - Guards, indicated by the when keyword, let you fine-tune the pattern matching based on the content of arguments

Underscoring That You Don’t Care
  - You can try to assign values to the underscore but elixir considers them permanently unbound after

Adding Structure: Tuples
  - Often (but not always) an atom at the beginning of the tuple indicates what its for
