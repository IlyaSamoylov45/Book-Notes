CHAPTER 1 Getting Comfortable
  - docker run -it elixir

Calling Functions
  - parenthesis optional
  - can refer to line number with v(), can use negative to refer to previous results!

Numbers in Elixir
  - Floating point, integers
  - put - in front of number to make it negative
  - iex> -0xcafe
         -51966
  - iex> 0b01010111
         87
  - iex> -0b01010111
         -87

Working with Variables in the Shell
  - Elixir, unlike many other functional programming languages, allows you assign n a new value
    - iex> k = 6
           6
      iex> k = k+2
           8
  - You can also put multiple statements on a line with ;
    iex> k = 6; m = 2
  - clear
    - iex> clear
