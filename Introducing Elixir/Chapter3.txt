CHAPTER 3 Atoms, Tuples, and Pattern Matching

Atoms
  - Atoms have a value—it’s the same as their text
  - What makes atoms exciting is the way that they can combine with other types and Elixir’s pattern-matching techniques to build simple but powerful logical structures.

Pattern Matching with Atoms
  - Atoms play a key role in pattern matching.

Atomic Booleans
  - Elixir uses the values true and false to represent the boolean logic values of the same names.
